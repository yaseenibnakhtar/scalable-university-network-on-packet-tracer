<h1 align="center">Scalable University Network Design (IIUI) ðŸš€</h1>

<p>This project presents the design and implementation of a scalable multi-building network infrastructure for the International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI). It features efficient <strong>IP subnetting</strong>, <strong>VLAN segmentation</strong>, <strong>dynamic routing (OSPF)</strong>, and <strong>robust security protocols</strong> to address current and future connectivity needs.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Subnetting & VLANs</strong>: Logical division of IP space and traffic isolation for optimized performance and scalability.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic & Static Routing</strong>: OSPF ensures seamless routing within the network, with static routes for external connectivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Resiliency & Redundancy</strong>: CORE routers with redundant paths and backup ISP connections ensure fault tolerance.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Enhancements</strong>: Access Control Lists (ACLs), SSH, NAT, and VLAN isolation safeguard the network.</li>
  <li><strong>Infrastructure Optimization</strong>: High-speed GigabitEthernet links and failover mechanisms for reduced latency and improved throughput.</li>
  <li><strong>Future-Ready Design</strong>: Scalable IP addressing scheme and support for future integrations like IPv6 and advanced technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Packet Tracer</strong>: Used for simulation and visualization.</li>
  <li><strong>TCP/IP Protocols</strong>: Backbone of the network for reliable communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)</strong>: Prevents network loops for efficient traffic flow.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project empowers IIUI with a robust, secure, and future-proof digital infrastructure, enhancing academic and administrative capabilities.</p>
