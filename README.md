Scalable University Network Design ðŸš€
This project presents the design and implementation of a scalable multi-building network infrastructure for the International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI). It features efficient IP subnetting, VLAN segmentation, dynamic routing (OSPF), and robust security protocols to address current and future connectivity needs.

Key Features:
Subnetting & VLANs: Logical division of IP space and traffic isolation for optimized performance and scalability.
Dynamic & Static Routing: OSPF ensures seamless routing within the network, with static routes for external connectivity.
Resiliency & Redundancy: CORE routers with redundant paths and backup ISP connections ensure fault tolerance.
Security Enhancements: Access Control Lists (ACLs), SSH, NAT, and VLAN isolation safeguard the network.
Infrastructure Optimization: High-speed GigabitEthernet links and failover mechanisms for reduced latency and improved throughput.
Future-Ready Design: Scalable IP addressing scheme and support for future integrations like IPv6 and advanced technologies.
Technologies:
Packet Tracer: Used for simulation and visualization.
TCP/IP Protocols: Backbone of the network for reliable communication.
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP): Prevents network loops for efficient traffic flow.
This project empowers IIUI with a robust, secure, and future-proof digital infrastructure, enhancing academic and administrative capabilities.
